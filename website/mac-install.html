	<title>Fuego Installation Instructions for Mac OS X</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Fuego installation instructions for Mac OS X</h1>

<p>
These instructions require command-line developer tools such as
<code>svn</code> (Subversion - a version control system), 
<code>gcc</code> (a compiler) and <code>autoreconf</code> 
(part of the autotools collection for creating
configuration and makefiles). These tools are installed when you
install Xcode from the App Store, and have it install the command
line tools. See <a href="#appendix1">appendix 1</a>
below for how to do this.
</p>

<p>
Apple, in its infinite wisdom, decided to leave out the autotools
collection with Mountain Lion and its associated version of Xcode,
so these must be installed separately if you are using OS X 10.8
and above. See <a href="#appendix2">appendix 2</a> below for how 
to do this.
</p>

<p>
With developer tools installed, and paths set correctly, The first 
task is to retrieve and install the appropriate Boost libraries. 
Download the most recent version from boost.org. On 29 July 2013,
that version is 1.54.0.
</p>

<p>
Un-tar that in a directory of your choice. For my examples below,
I will show a user called yama installing into a folder
called igo. Assuming you have downloaded the tar.gz file into
that directory, open the Terminal application and use the the
following commands:
<pre>
cd ~/igo
tar -zxvf boost_1_54_0.tar.gz
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Now build the boost libraries that are needed for Fuego, and put
them into a separate directory:
<pre>
cd  boost_1_54_0/
./bootstrap.sh --prefix=../boost --with-libraries=thread,system,date_time,filesystem,program_options,test
./b2 install
</pre>
</p>

<p>
This process will take a little bit of time as it copies a lot of
files, and compiles a few others. When completed you should have
the following:
<pre>
/Users/yama/igo/boost_1_54_0.tar.gz
/Users/yama/igo/boost_1_54_0/  &lt;-- filled with lots of stuff
/Users/yama/igo/boost/
/Users/yama/igo/boost/include/boost/  &lt;-- filled with lots of stuff
/Users/yama/igo/boost/lib/  &lt;-- filled with library executables
</pre>
</p>

<p>
To make sure that these libraries are visible, we need to export
the path to the libraries (assuming you are still using the default
bash shell):
<pre>
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:/Users/yama/igo/boost/lib
</pre>
Note that any time you compile or run Fuego, this variable needs to be
in your environment. You can check if it is there by typing:
<pre>
echo $DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
</pre>
If the response is blank, you will need to export it again.
</p>

<p>
Now we go and get Fuego. There is no tar file that contains the 
latest version of Fuego, so we get it directly from the repository
using <code>svn</code>:
<pre>
cd ..   &lt;-- here you want to end up in the /Users/yama/igo/  directory.
svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/fuego/code/trunk fuego
</pre>
This should create a folder named fuego in the desired directory, in
this case our example will now have a directory 
<code>/Users/yama/igo/fuego</code>
filled with all the Fuego code.
</p>

<p>
Now we need to create the configure file using <code>autoreconf</code>, 
run the produced configure file, and then finally make the project:
<pre>
cd fuego
autoreconf --force --install
./configure --with-boost=/Users/yama/igo/boost  --with-boost-libdir=/Users/yama/igo/boost/lib
make
</pre>
Please note that when you run the <code>./configure</code> for Fuego here, the
<code>--with-boost=</code> and <code>--with-boost-libdir=</code> paths 
must be absolute paths, not relative paths: the entire pathname starting at 
<code>/</code> must be there. For example, do not use the shortcut 
<code>--with-boost=../boost</code>. It will not work.
</p>
<p>
Another reminder: any time you run Fuego, the <code>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>
variable must be set.
</p>

<h3>Installation on Linux</h3>
<p>
In order to use these instructions on a Linux install instead of Mac OS, 
you need to change the <code>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> to 
<code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>. Additionally
note that most Linux installations locate users home directories 
in <code>/home</code>, not <code>/Users</code>.

<h2>How to install the Xcode command line tools</h2>

<p>
To install the command line tools needed such as gcc and svn,
you must first install Xcode itself. Xcode is available through
the Apple App Store application. 
</p>
<p>
Open the "App Store" application, found in the Applications folder,
and do a search for Xcode. Install Xcode by clicking on the 'Free' button,
and then clicking on it again after it becomes the 'Install App' button.
After a long download and install, you will find the Xcode application
in your Applications folder.
</p>
<p>
Start up Xcode, and open up its Preferences (from the Xcode menu). Choose
the 'Downloads' tab, and inside that choose the 'Components' tab. One of
the components that you can install is the "Command Line Tools". Install
these and test that you have them installed by using the following commands
in a Terminal window (the Terminal application is found in the Utilities
folder inside the Applications folder):
<pre>
which gcc   &lt;--  should respond with /usr/bin/gcc
which svn   &lt;--  should respond with /usr/bin/svn
</pre>
If these commands have given the correct responses, you are ready to proceed.
</p>

<h1>Appendix 2</h1>

<h2>How to install autotools on Mac OS</h2>

<p>
The <code>autoconf</code>, <code>automake</code>, and 
<code>libtool</code> packages (all part of the
autotools collection) should be installed in  order to be able to 
use the autoreconf command to create Fuego's 'configure' file.
</p>

<p>
I recommend using the following shell script to install all three
of these tools. Alternatively you can manually type in the commands
found in the script. You must modify the script to place the tools in
a directory of your choice. I show this one being put into a
devtools directory in the yama user's igo directory, but you
may or may not want to have the tools installed into <code>/usr/local</code>.
The advantage is that if in <code>/usr/local</code> they are already on the
<code>PATH</code> variable. The disadvantage is that you may forget to remove
them from there (or may damage other things when you do) should
you ever decide you don't need them. You can also modify the script 
to install more recent versions of the tools. You may want to visit
the websites to investigate which version is the most recent.
</p>

<p>
Copy and paste the following (between, but not including,
the ---------- lines) into a file named, for example,
<code>createDevTools.sh</code>. If you created this file in the
<code>/Users/yama/igo</code> directory, then make the file executable by 
typing the following commands in the Terminal application:
<pre>
cd /Users/yama/igo
chmod 755 createDevTools.sh
</pre>
Then execute it by using:
<pre>
./createDevTools.sh
</pre>
You will have to type in your password the first time the script
uses '<code>sudo</code>' in an install.
</p>
<p>
Remember that if you want to use any of the autotools in a different
Terminal window or shell, you will need to add the installation
directory's bin directory to the <code>PATH</code> variable, e.g.:
<pre>
export PATH=$PATH:/Users/yama/igo/devtools/bin
</pre>
unless you installed into <code>/usr/local</code>.
</p>
